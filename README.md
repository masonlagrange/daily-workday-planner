# Daily Workday Planner

## Description
This project was made as a simple introduction to using third party apis, as well as changing html properties using javascript. The project uses the day.js api to fetch the time and date so that it can be compared to defined time slots, where the affected elements can have their html tags changed by javascript.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The page will display the date at the top. The time blocks will be highlighted base on whether or not they are past, present, or future. Each block contains a text field which can be filled and saved to local storage, which will display when the page is refreshed.
